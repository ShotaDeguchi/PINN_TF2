# PINN(s): Physics-Informed Neural Network(s) for 2D wave equation

This is an implementation of [PINN(s)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045) on TensorFlow 2 to solve 2D wave equation under Dirichlet / Neumann boundary condition without training data (data to fit initial & boundary conditions need to be provided). This is enabled by [automatic differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767), which is a generalization of [back-propagation](https://doi.org/10.1038/323533a0). Within this, PINN-derived solution is compared with FDM (Finite Difference Method) approximation to show a quantitative agreement. While training could be accelerated with GPU-utilized learning, this code also implements [L-LAAF](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2020.0334) for further speed-up. 

## Solution
FDM simulation (at t = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0 (s)):

With the present setting, the error between FDM and PINN is as follows (scale: 1e-5):
|t|0.5|1.5|5.0|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|mse(&plusmn;sem)|0.297(&plusmn;0.003)|0.551(&plusmn;0.004)|4.273(&plusmn;0.028)|

## Usage
Simply type
<br>
<code>
  python main.py
</code>
<br>
to run the entire code (this includes FDM simulation, PINN training, inferece, and comparison). Basic parameters (e.g., network architecture, batch size, initializer, etc.) are found in 
<br>
<code>
  params.py
</code>
<br>
and could be modified depending on the problem setup. 

## Environment
Tested on 
<br>
<code>
